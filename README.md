# LuckyNetwork Security Incident Response Plan

This document outlines the procedures and guidelines for responding to security incidents at LuckyNetwork.

The Security Incident Response Plan (SIRP) is not included in this document. The SIRP is a separate document that provides a step-by-step process for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security breaches, as well as reporting and documenting incidents.

This document covers the following topics:
1. Team Roles and Responsibilities: Roles and responsibilities of the security teams involved in incident response.
2. Example Attack Scenarios: Examples of common attack scenarios and how to respond to them.
3. Out-of-band Communication: Secure communication channels for coordinating the incident response effort.
4. Special Powers for Security Leader (CSO) and Security Engineer.

This is a living document and will be updated as needed to reflect changes in the security landscape and LuckyNetwork's security posture. This document was based on the Security Standard 2022.
